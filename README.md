# **Python Programming for Beginners**
    
*31 March - 2 April 2025*

Proudly brought to you by the School for Data Science and Computational Thinking at
Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa

# 1. Overview:

More data is being generated and stored than ever before. We generate data through
various processes. For example, we generate data when we transact at a shop, when our
smart watches record our steps, and when we record a Zoom meeting. Given the
advancement in computational power and storage, we are using these stored datasets
to make sense of the world around us and to make decisions. These decisions can help
to advance business, health, sporting and other outcomes.
A key part of data science is learning how to code and use programming to build
data-driven models. This workshop provides a beginner-friendly introduction to
Python for data science. You will start with the basics of Python coding and
gradually apply it to real-world data science problems.

# 2. Outcomes:
Participants will gain competency in the following:
- Fundamental Python programming concepts
- Data manipulation and analysis with Python
- Introduction to data visualization
- Python libraries such as such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Seaborn,
Statsmodels, Numpy
- Practical exercises and real-world examples

# 3. Syllabus and Schedule:

The workshop is scheduled to take place from March 31st to April 2nd, 2025 with sessions held daily from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM South African Standard Time (SAST).
